The scripts in this repository help me to manage my TrueNAS homelab.

Tools:

- [Immich Folder Album Creator](https://github.com/BKell-Dog/TrueNAS-Tools/tree/master/Immich%20Auto%20Album), from [Salvoxia](https://github.com/Salvoxia/immich-folder-album-creator).
- Spotify To M3U, a tool to read the tracks in a Spotify playlist, and record their order into an M3U file. I combine this with my [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) server to mimic my Spotify playlists.
